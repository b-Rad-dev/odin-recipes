        <p>This delicious slow-roasted pork is rubbed with sea salt and liquid smoke to recall the glorious flavors of pig cooked in a traditional Hawaiian imu. Once cooked and cooled, it can be shredded and served with poi, yams or even on a bun. You may use ordinary sea salt for this recipe if the Hawaiian variety is unavailable.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds pork butt roast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavouring</li>
            <li>2.5 tablespoons Hawaiian sea salt, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Rub liquid smoke and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the salt into the skin of the pork. Wrap well in foil, and seal completely. Place in a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) is reached, about 5 hours. Remove from oven and let cool before shredding. Sprinkle the shredded meat with the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt.</li>
        </ol>
