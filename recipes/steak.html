        <h3>Entrecote, also known as Steak-Frites</h3>
        <p>This dish is popular in France and consists of a thin-sliced hanger steak cooked to order, covered in the most addictive herb butter you have ever had. Pairs well with a nice bottle of Cabernet Sauvigon.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 hanger steaks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 anchovy fillets, chopped, or more to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chervil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steaks to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a plate to rest.</li>
            <li>Place shallots in the skillet and cook until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Pour wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add broth and anchovy; cook until thickened to sauce consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; whisk butter in gradually. Stir parsley, chervil, and thyme into the sauce. Puree sauce in the skillet with an immersion blender until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cut steaks into thin slices across the grain; spoon sauce over slices.</li>
        </ol>
