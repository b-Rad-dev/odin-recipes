# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be building a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
I will be showing my ability to build multiple pages linking back to one another while using basic heading, paragraph, and list commands.
Simple visuals will be added using img src commands and alt txt.
